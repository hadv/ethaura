# üîê Recovery UI - Quick Start Guide

## What is the Recovery Manager?

The Recovery Manager is a UI component that allows guardians to propose, approve, and execute wallet recovery transactions. It's used when users lose access to their passkeys or Web3Auth accounts.

## Key Concepts

### Guardians
- Trusted addresses that can help recover your account
- Owner is automatically the first guardian
- Can add more guardians for better security

### Recovery Request
- A proposal to change the passkey or owner
- Requires multiple guardian approvals (based on threshold)
- Has a 24-hour timelock before execution

### Threshold
- Number of guardian approvals needed
- Example: 2 out of 3 guardians must approve

## How to Use

### 1. Check Guardian Status
When you open the Recovery Manager, you'll see:
- Total number of guardians
- Approval threshold (e.g., "2 of 3")
- Whether you're a guardian

### 2. Propose Recovery (If You're a Guardian)

**Step 1:** Click "Propose Recovery"

**Step 2:** Choose recovery type:
- **Update Passkey**: Set new passkey coordinates (qx, qy)
- **Update Owner**: Change account owner address

**Step 3:** Enter the new values:
- For passkey: Enter new X and Y coordinates
- For owner: Enter new owner address

**Step 4:** Click "üìù Propose Recovery"

**Result:** Recovery request created with a nonce (ID)

### 3. Approve Recovery (If You're a Guardian)

**Step 1:** Look at "Pending Recovery Requests"

**Step 2:** Find the recovery you want to approve

**Step 3:** Click "‚úÖ Approve"

**Result:** Your approval is recorded, approval count increases

### 4. Wait for Timelock

The recovery has a 24-hour timelock. During this time:
- ‚è≥ Countdown shows time remaining
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Owner can cancel if malicious
- üîí Prevents immediate compromise

### 5. Execute Recovery

**When ready:**
- Approval count ‚â• threshold
- 24 hours have passed

**Step 1:** Click "üöÄ Execute"

**Result:** Recovery executed, account updated!
