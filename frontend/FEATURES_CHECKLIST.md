# EthAura Frontend - Features Checklist

## ✅ All Required Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Create Passkey (Touch ID/Face ID)

**Component:** `PasskeyManager.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Uses WebAuthn API (`navigator.credentials.create`)
- Supports platform authenticators (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello)
- P-256/ES256 algorithm (`alg: -7`)
- Extracts and displays public key (x, y coordinates)
- Stores credential ID for future signing

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "🔑 Create Passkey"
2. Browser prompts for biometric authentication
3. Passkey created with P-256 public key
4. Public key displayed (x, y coordinates)

**Code Location:** Lines 9-80 in `PasskeyManager.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 2. ✅ Get Account Address Instantly

**Component:** `AccountManager.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Uses SDK's `createAccount()` method
- Calculates deterministic address using CREATE2
- **Counterfactual deployment** - address available before deployment
- Shows address immediately after creation
- No blockchain transaction needed

**User Flow:**
1. User creates passkey
2. User logs in with Web3Auth
3. User clicks "🚀 Deploy Account with 2FA"
4. SDK calculates address using CREATE2
5. Address shown instantly (account NOT deployed yet!)

**Code Location:** Lines 40-86 in `AccountManager.jsx`

**Key Code:**
```javascript
const accountData = await sdk.createAccount(
  credential.publicKey,
  ownerAddress,
  0n // salt
)
// accountData.address is available immediately!
```

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 3. ✅ Fund Account with ETH

**Component:** `AccountManager.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Displays account address for funding
- Shows clear instructions for funding
- Links to Sepolia faucet
- Explains counterfactual deployment
- Account can receive ETH before deployment

**User Flow:**
1. Account address displayed
2. User sees funding instructions
3. User sends ETH from:
   - Sepolia faucet (https://sepoliafaucet.com)
   - Existing wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
   - Centralized exchange
4. ETH received at counterfactual address

**Code Location:** Lines 181-205 in `AccountManager.jsx`

**UI Features:**
- ⚠️ Warning box with funding instructions
- 📤 Links to Sepolia faucet
- 💡 Explanation of counterfactual deployment
- ⚡ Note about automatic deployment

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 4. ✅ Send Transactions (Deploys on First Use)

**Component:** `TransactionSender.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Uses SDK's `sendEth()` functionality
- Builds UserOperation with `buildSendEthUserOp()`
- Includes `initCode` for first transaction (deployment)
- Submits to bundler via `sdk.bundler.sendUserOperationAndWait()`
- Automatically deploys account on first transaction
- Subsequent transactions skip deployment

**User Flow:**
1. User enters recipient address and amount
2. User clicks "📤 Send Transaction"
3. SDK builds UserOperation
4. User signs with passkey (Touch ID/Face ID)
5. If 2FA enabled, user signs with Web3Auth
6. SDK submits to bundler
7. **First transaction:** Account deploys + transaction executes
8. **Subsequent transactions:** Only transaction executes

**Code Location:** Lines 38-133 in `TransactionSender.jsx`

**Key Code:**
```javascript
const userOp = await buildSendEthUserOp({
  accountAddress,
  targetAddress,
  amount: amountWei,
  provider: sdk.provider,
  needsDeployment: !accountInfo.deployed, // ← Automatic detection
  initCode: accountInfo.deployed ? '0x' : await sdk.accountManager.getInitCode(...),
})

const receipt = await sdk.bundler.sendUserOperationAndWait(signedUserOp)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic deployment detection
- ✅ initCode included for first transaction
- ✅ Bundler submission
- ✅ Transaction tracking
- ✅ Status updates during signing
- ✅ Success confirmation with tx hash

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5. ✅ Optional 2FA for Security

**Components:** `AccountManager.jsx`, `TransactionSender.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Checks 2FA status via `accountInfo.twoFactorEnabled`
- Requires both signatures when 2FA enabled:
  1. Passkey signature (P-256)
  2. Owner signature (ECDSA from Web3Auth)
- Combines signatures: `r (32) + s (32) + ownerSig (65) = 129 bytes`
- Shows 2FA status in UI

**User Flow:**
1. Account created with owner address (Web3Auth)
2. 2FA can be enabled on-chain (via `enableTwoFactor()`)
3. When sending transaction:
   - If 2FA disabled: Only passkey signature needed
   - If 2FA enabled: Both passkey + owner signatures needed
4. UI shows 2FA status clearly

**Code Location:**
- Check 2FA: Lines 25-38 in `AccountManager.jsx`
- Sign with 2FA: Lines 98-104 in `TransactionSender.jsx`
- Combine signatures: Lines 106-113 in `TransactionSender.jsx`

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Check if 2FA is enabled
let ownerSig = null
if (accountInfo.twoFactorEnabled) {
  setStatus('🔐 Signing with Web3Auth wallet (2FA)...')
  ownerSig = await signMessage(ethers.getBytes(userOpHash))
  setOwnerSignature(ownerSig)
}

// Combine signatures
const signedUserOp = signUserOperation(
  userOp,
  { r: passkeyR, s: passkeyS },
  ownerSig // null if 2FA disabled, signature if enabled
)
```

**UI Indicators:**
- 🔒 2FA badge in account info
- Different button text: "🔐 Send Transaction (2FA)" vs "📤 Send Transaction"
- Shows both signatures when 2FA used
- Explains dual signature requirement

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
