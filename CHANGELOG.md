## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first public release of EthAura, a P-256 Account Abstraction implementation.

**⚠️ WARNING: This is experimental software. Not audited. Do not use with real funds.**

#### What's New

EthAura enables Ethereum users to control their accounts using WebAuthn/Passkeys (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) instead of traditional private keys. This is made possible by:

1. **EIP-7951 Precompile**: Efficient P-256 signature verification (~6,900 gas)
2. **ERC-4337 Integration**: Full Account Abstraction support
3. **WebAuthn Support**: Native passkey integration

#### Key Features

- 🔐 **Passkey Authentication**: Use biometrics to sign transactions
- ⚡ **Gas Efficient**: Native precompile verification
- 🏭 **Factory Pattern**: Deterministic account addresses
- 🔄 **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple transactions
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, desktop

#### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Deploy to Sepolia
make deploy-sepolia

# Run frontend
make frontend
```

See [README.md](./README.md) for detailed instructions.

#### Known Limitations

- Only available on Sepolia testnet (post-Fusaka)
- Not audited for production use
- Single public key per account
- No social recovery (yet)
- No paymaster integration (yet)

#### Breaking Changes

N/A (initial release)

#### Migration Guide

N/A (initial release)

#### Acknowledgments

- Ethereum Foundation for EIP-7951
- Account Abstraction team for ERC-4337
- W3C for WebAuthn specification
- OpenZeppelin for contract libraries
