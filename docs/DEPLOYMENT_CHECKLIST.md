```

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Check precompile
cast call <FACTORY_ADDRESS> "isPrecompileAvailable()(bool)" --rpc-url sepolia

# Create account
cast send <FACTORY_ADDRESS> \
  "createAccount(bytes32,bytes32,address,uint256)" \
  <QX> <QY> <OWNER> 0 \
  --rpc-url sepolia \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Get account address
cast call <FACTORY_ADDRESS> \
